# Bare-bones Nextjs starter

There are an incredible amount of Javascript frameworks and meta-frameworks to learn. With React, two of the most common metaframeworks of the moment are Next.js, made by Zeit, and Gatsby.

**Next.js is incredible in its simplicity and flexibility;** there are less prescriptive guiderails placed on developers in the implementation of an app or site. 

If you'd like to skip ahead and reference 'final' versions of the starter, feel free to checkout the [implementation with TinaCMS](https://github.com/kendallstrautman/brevifolia-next-tinacms)ðŸ¦™ or basic [implementation with Forestry](https://github.com/kendallstrautman/brevifolia-next-forestry)ðŸŒ².
